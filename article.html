                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Hey what's up,<br>TheIndieGamer here,&nbsp;<br><br>Okay so starting with windows XP it was great, then windows vista was not great, but then windows 7 was great, then windows 8 with the tiles not great, windows 10 great and now windows 11.&nbsp;<br>No pressure Microsoft but this is your chance to break that cycle.<br></p>
                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">So we got Microsoft reveal the newest next version of windows coming as a free upgrade this holiday season to a pc near you. so we'll get to the app situation in a minute but there's plenty of interesting stuff now that they're doing here in windows11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>First of all the whole aesthetic is refreshed pretty dramatically so we got this new design that I would describe as very glassy like there's a lot of shininess and transparency and glassy translucent elements things happening through here as much as it's probably cringe to say it kinda reminds me a little bit of the hype around windows vista when we had that super flat windows XP and then vista was all this glass but of course now it's much brighter and lighter and I'm just gonna stop mentioning vista now.<br><br><br></p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/videoplayer/embed/RWFAqd?pid=player-container2-oneplayer&amp;autoplay=true&amp;mute=false&amp;loop=false&amp;market=en-in&amp;useAdaptive=false&amp;playFullScreen=false" width="450" height="300"></iframe>
                        <h2 style="font-size: 22px;">The new start menu </h2>
                        <p class="lead text-start" style="font-size: 18px;">In Windows 11 the overall concept of the new start menu which might make you a little nervous if you're familiar with them messing with the start button and the start menu in the past, but it's pretty good it's actually centered now by default to keep up with the theme that Windows 11 should be the center of your ecosystem but you can always move it back over to the left if you want but yeah it has the glassy look it also now has suggestions for apps and documents to open that you recently used.<br>Makes a lot of sense here and then similar to how on android you could swipe over to see a google discover page or on IOS, how you could swipe over to see a bunch of widgets with information or even on the mac. You could do this now on windows 11 too, you can swipe over and get a pane of widgets with information customized by AI.<br><br>So it's this glassy pullover and I assume it'll get better over time as it learns you, but it has some level of customization and so you can see things like weather, news stories and social posts all over here and you can fully swipe over to go full screen with this that windows 11 should be the center of your ecosystem but you can always move it back over to the left if you want.<br><br>Yeah it has the glassy look, but it also now has suggestions for apps and documents to open that you recently used makes a lot of sense here and then similar to how on android you could swipe over to see a google discover page or on IOS how you could swipe over to see a bunch of widgets with information or even on the mac you could do this, now on windows 11 you can swipe over and you get a pane of widgets with information customized by AI.<br><br>So it's this glassy pullover and I assume it'll get better over time as it learns you but it has some level of customization and so you can see things like weather and news stories and social posts all over here and you can fully swipe over to go full screen with this.<br><br><br></p>

                        <h2 style="font-size: 22px;">Leveling up Microsoft Teams</h2>
                        <p class="lead text-start" style="font-size: 18px;">If you want to just live here for a little bit it's pretty cool then here's an interesting no doubt pandemic inspired feature, Microsoft teams is now built into windows natively. <br>Now okay here's the thing Microsoft Teams, I get it, it's their communication app they want to use it as much as possible but also, Uh Microsoft owns skype and they bought skype for 8.5 billion dollars. So when I think of what Microsoft could do to like make communication easier in windows that's just what came to my head but you know they're trying to promote teams and make it the default messaging app and push it more among regular people.<br>Microsoft like I said owns skype, but also now facetime from this recent IOS update will allow you to send links to people on android phones, web devices and windows users can jump on facetimes now. So yeah I don't know if Microsoft teams is going to be that thing that hard hitting standard default but we'll see.<br></p>

                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">So those are all the big new changes the huge bullet points. Windows 11 is looking fresh and clean with this new aesthetic and I am definitely on board with that part it feels modern and there's lots of other behind the scenes and under the hood changes as well, I'm sure it's 64-bit only for one and there are also a couple other more interesting new system requirements. So there's a compatibility tool that people can now use to check if their pc they currently have, will work with windows 11. I think we'll learn a lot more as the betas start rolling out and people start using them about graphics improvements, security, privacy, optimizations and all that fun stuff but in the meantime that's windows 11.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">So not bad I'm impressed I think they might have just broken the cycle, the on-off.&nbsp;<br>I don't want to jinx it but I kind of like this update we'll see.<br></p>
                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Thanks for reading,<br>Catch you guys in the next one.<br></p>
                        <p style="font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">Peace.</p>
